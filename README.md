# Journal Prompt Project

The goal of this project is to provide journal prompts while also providing a learning opportunity for me to sharpen my skills. For this project, we'll be exploring **node.js**, **React**, and possibly **iOS** later on...

* The **/server** folder provides a simple **node.js** server that generates a random prompt.
* The **/journal-prompt-app** folder stores the **React** app that allows the user to receive a prompt.

## Future Ideas
Using the same **node.js** server, we should also be able to create a mobile app that allows the user to receive a prompt on their device.
